### Assumptions

Reasonable familiarity with R as a programming language, including use of [pipe operator](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html) `%>%` and functions.

### Step 0

Familiarisation with [r-simmer](https://r-simmer.org/)

Vignettes are in [r-simmer vignettes/](r-simmer vignettes/)

Take a look at [The Bank Tutorial: Part I](https://r-simmer.org/articles/simmer-04-bank-1.html).

Important concepts: `seize`,`timeout`,`release`,`add_generator`,`add_resource`

Look at "Balking and reneging customers" from [The Bank Tutorial: Part II](https://r-simmer.org/articles/simmer-04-bank-2.html#balking-and-reneging-customers)

Important concepts: `renege_in`,`renege_abort`

Keep the [r-simmer reference](https://r-simmer.org/reference/) open during subsequent steps.

### Step 1

Build a simple model of an ICU with 16 beds, and elective and emergency patients arriving.

Some suggestions for a sensible model:

* `add_resource("bed",16)`
* Emergency intervals: `round(rexp(1,1/1))`
* Elective intervals: `round(rexp(1,1/3))`
* Patient stay: `timeout(function() {round(runif(1,0,30))})`
* Suggest putting the model environment into a wrapper for later Monte-Carlo use

**Solution:** [1 - Partmodel-BedsOnly.R](1 - Partmodel-BedsOnly.R)

### Step 2

Update model to include nurses as a resource. Our ICU has 12 nurses; patients require 1 nurse when level 3, and can share a nurse when level 2 or below.

Some suggestions:

* `add_resource("halfnurse",24)`
* 50% split between starting L3/L2 - `seize("halfnurse", function() { if (runif(1)<0.5) 2 else 1 })`
* At initial level - `timeout(function() {round(runif(1,0,15))})`
* At lower level (after releasing half a nurse if L3) - `timeout(function() {round(runif(1,0,15))})`

**Solution:** [2 - Partmodel-AddedNurses.R](2 - Partmodel-AddedNurses.R)

### Step 3

Split single patient trajectory into elective vs emergency. Elective patients return a week later if they are rejected.

Some suggestions:

* Split out a common patient trajectory for once a patient has been admitted (of either type) - use `join()`
* Elective: `timeout(0.1)` to make emergency patients take priority
* Use `rollback()` to allow elective patients to return

**Solution:** [3 - Partmodel-ElectiveAndEmergency.R](3 - Partmodel-ElectiveAndEmergency.R)

### Step 4

Generate ICNARC L3/2/1/0 days at the start of an admission (randomly) and then drive trajectories based on these

Some suggestions:

* Split out a "generator" trajectory to handle the generation
* `set_attribute` to store the days once generated
* If >0 L3 days, patient will need a whole nurse to be admitted, and can drop to 1:2 later
* (Optional) - correct stays using an offset, for the way ICNARC days are calculated (eg 8pm-8am counts as 2 days)
* Some sensible values: L3 - `rpois(1,5)`, L2 - `rpois(1,5)`, L1 - `rpois(1,3)`, L0 - `rpois(1,1)`

**Solution:** [4 - Partmodel-DaysAsAttributes.R](4 - Partmodel-DaysAsAttributes.R)

### Step 5

Create a generator function for time gaps between patients so we can later model changes by day etc

Some suggestions:

* Use a [closure](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html#closures) to keep track of the current date and when the last patient was generated
* Return inter-arrival time gaps (which may be zero), and -1 to finish
* Some sensible values: `rpois(1,mean)` where mean is 0.7 for emergency and 0.3 for elective

**Solution:** [5 - Partmodel-PoissonGenerator.R](5 - Partmodel-PoissonGenerator.R)

### Step 6

Drive the model with real data from [ICNARC Test Data.csv](ICNARC Test Data.csv)

Some suggestions:

* To read data in:
```r
patients<-read.csv("ICNARC Test Data.csv",header=TRUE,sep=",",colClasses=c("Admission.Date"="character"))
patients$Admission.Date<-as.Date(patients$Admission.Date,format="%d/%m/%Y")
```
* Calculate totals by weekday (or business day) and admission type
* In generator, use mean for current weekday/type as input to the `rpois`
* In patient days generator trajectory, select a real patient of the appropriate type (use `set_attribute` and `get_attribute` to store patient types)
* Use `mclapply` to run a Monte-Carlo simulation (environment needs to be in a wrapper if it isn't already)

**Solution:** [6 - Partmodel-DataDriven.R](6 - Partmodel-DataDriven.R)

### Extra credit

* Add repatriations and transfers in, handled sensibly. Repatriations are lower priority but will usually be re-requested the following day if rejected. Transfers in are lowest priority.
* Make pretty graphs to demonstrate the model's power
* Tweak the model parameters (eg beds, nurses) and see what the effects would be
* Compare what would happen if "delayed discharges" were removed earlier (L1 and below)
* Simulate an increase in elective/emergency workload
